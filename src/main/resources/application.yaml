# In company, project run on 2 mode: development and production and for both mode configuration of application file is different like mongo server, port etc.
# For this reason spring provides mode :- dev and prod.
# This is the default file which spring boot run and in this you can say which files runnable either dev or prod.
# If you do not create default file and create only application-dev and application-prod file then you want to give profile in edit configuration --> system variable like spring.profiles.active=dev or prod.

spring:
#  You can also write the common configuration of dev and prod file.
